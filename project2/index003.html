<a href="index002_0.html">Verdana</a> is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by<br>
<a href="index002_1.html">Matthew Carter</a> for <a href="index002_2.html">Microsoft Corporation</a>, with hand-hinting<br> done
by <a href="index002_3.html">Thomas Rickner</a>, then at Monotype. Demand for such  <br>
a typeface was recognized by <a href="index002_4.html">Virginia Howlett</a> of Microsoft's <br>typography group. The name "Verdana" is based on <br>
verdant (something green), and Ana (the name of Howlett's <br>eldest daughter).
Bearing similarities to humanist sans-serif<br> typefaces such as <a href="index002_5.html">Frutiger</a>,Verdana was designed to be readable at <br>
small sizes on <a href="index002_6.html">the low-resolution computer screens</a> of the period. <br>
The <a href="index002_7.html">lack of serifs</a>, <a href="index002_8.html">large x-height</a>, 
<a href="index002_9.html">wide proportions</a>, <a href="index002_10.html">loose <br>
letter-spacing</a>, <a href="index002_11.html">large counters</a>, and emphasized distinctions <br>
between similarly-shaped characters are chosen to increase <br>legibility 
for body text. The bold weight is thicker than <br>
would be normal with fonts for print use, a decision made <br>
to suit the limitations of onscreen display. According to <br>a study of 
online fonts by the Software Usability and Research <br>
Laboratory at <a href="index002_12.html">Wichita State University</a>,
participants preferred<br> Verdana to be the best overall font choice and <br>
it was also perceived as being among the most legible fonts.
