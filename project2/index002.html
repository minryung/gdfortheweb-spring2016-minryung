Verdana is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Matthew Carter<br>
for Microsoft Corporation, with hand-hinting done by Thomas Rickner, <br>
then at Monotype. Demand for such a typeface was recognized by Virginia <br>
Howlett of Microsoft's typography group. The name "Verdana" is based on <br>
verdant (something green), and Ana (the name of Howlett's eldest daughter).<br>
Bearing similarities to humanist sans-serif typefaces such as Frutiger,<br>
Verdana was designed to be readable at small sizes on the low-resolution <br>
computer screens of the period.[2] The lack of serifs, large x-height, <br>
wide proportions, loose letter-spacing, large counters, and emphasized <br>
distinctions between similarly-shaped characters are chosen to increase <br>
legibility for body text. The bold weight is thicker than would be normal<br>
with fonts for print use, a decision made to suit the limitations of onscreen display.<br>
According to a study of online fonts by the Software Usability and Research <br>
Laboratory at Wichita State University, participants preferred Verdana to be<br>
 the best overall font choice and it was also perceived as being among the most legible fonts.
