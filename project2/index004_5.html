      <h3>Helvetica</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Helvetica is a widely used sans-serif typeface developed in 1957 by Swiss typeface designer <img src="4_1.png" width="100"></p><p> with input from <img src="4_2.png" width="100">. It is a neo-grotesque or realist design, one influenced </p>

      <p>by the famous 19th century typeface <img src="4_3.png" width="100"> and other German and Swiss designs. Its use</p>
      <p>became a hallmark of the International Typographic Style that emerged from the work of Swiss designers</p>

      <p>in the 1950s and 60s, becoming one of the <img src="4_4.png" width="100"> of the 20th century. Over the years, </p>

      <p>a wide range of variants have been released in different weights, widths and sizes, as well as matching</p>

      <p> designs for a range of non-Latin alphabets. Notable <img src="4_5.png" width="100"> as originally designed include</p>

      <p> the termination of all strokes on exactly horizontal or vertical lines and unusually tight letter</p>
      <p> spacing, which give it a dense, compact appearance.</p>
