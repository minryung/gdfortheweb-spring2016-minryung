<div class="verdana_content"><br>
<a href="index002_0.html">Verdana</a> is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by<br>
<a href="index002_1.html">Matthew Carter</a> for <a href="index002_2.html">Microsoft Corporation</a>, with hand-hinting done <br>
by <a href="index002_3.html">Thomas Rickner</a>, then at Monotype. Demand for such  <br>
a typeface was recognized by <a href="index002_4.html">Virginia Howlett</a> of Microsoft's <br>typography group. The name "Verdana" is based on <br>
verdant (something green), and Ana (the name of Howlett's <br>eldest daughter).
Bearing similarities to humanist sans-serif<br> typefaces such as <a href="index002_5.html">Frutiger</a>,Verdana was designed to be readable at <br>
small sizes on <a href="index002_6.html">the low-resolution computer screens</a> of the period. <br>
The <a href="index002_7.html">lack of serifs</a>, <a href="index002_8.html">large x-height</a>, 
<a href="index002_9.html">wide proportions</a>, <a href="index002_10.html">loose <br>
letter-spacing</a>, <a href="index002_11.html">large counters</a>, and emphasized distinctions <br>
between similarly-shaped characters are chosen to increase legibility <br>
for body text. The bold weight is thicker than would be normal<br>
with fonts for print use, a decision made to suit the limitations <br>
of onscreen display. According to a study of online fonts by the <br>
Software Usability and Research Laboratory at <a href="index002_12.html">Wichita State University</a>,<br>
participants preferred Verdana to be the best overall font choice and <br>
it was also perceived as being among the most legible fonts.
