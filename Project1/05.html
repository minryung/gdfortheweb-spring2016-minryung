<br>
Tut's Fever is a working movie theater and art installation created<br>
by Red Grooms and Lysiane Luong, an homage to the ornate, <br>
exotic picture palaces of the 1920s. Inspired by the tomb paintings <br>
they saw during a trip to Egypt, Grooms and Luong covered the walls, <br>
floor and seats of the theater with hand-painted, Egyptian-style depictions <br>
of Hollywood royalty. Silent screen star Theda Bara works the box office,<br> 
Mae West stands behind the concessions stand, and Mickey Rooney is the usher.<br>
Rudolf Valentino, Elizabeth Taylor and many others grace the walls,<br>
and each slipcovered chair in the theater features an image of Rita Hayworth.<br>
Visitors can open a sarcophagus to find a sculpture of James Dean lying in his tomb,<br>
cigarette still dangling from his mouth. Tut's Fever is a permanent feature <br>
of the Museum's core exhibition, Behind the Screen. Classic movie serials <br>
are screened in Tut's Fever every weekday at 2:00 p.m., <br>
and weekends at 1:00, 2:00, and 3:30 p.m.<br>
