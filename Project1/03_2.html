The Jim Henson Exhibition and Gallery<br>
<br>
Jim Henson's playful, endearing, gently subversive personality <br>
could be felt in all of the film and television work he created. <br>
Opening in 2016, The Jim Henson Exhibition will be a dynamic <br>
new visitor experience exploring Henson's transformative impact <br>
on popular culture. This comprehensive exhibition will feature<br>
a selection from the Museum's collection of nearly 500 objects<br>
related to Jim Henson's unparalleled career, including historic puppets,<br>
costumes, production design material, and licensed merchandise. <br>
These objects, donated to the Museum by Henson's family, <br>
will be featured along with character sketches, storyboards, <br>
scripts, behind-the-scenes footage, and interactive experiences <br>
highlighting Henson's immense contributions to the art and<br> 
industry of the moving image.<br>
<br>
Henson's unique body of work continues to delight and inspire <br> 
people around the world. His creations include the enduringly <br> 
popular puppet characters of Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, <br> 
and Muppet films, which established his characters as international <br> 
superstars; and the fantastical worlds of Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal,<br> 
and Labyrinth. The exhibition will explore how Henson achieved this <br> 
remarkable success by working with a team of dedicated puppet builders, <br> 
designers, performers, and writers who shared his restless curiosity, <br> 
spirit of experimentation, and commitment to creative collaboration.<br>
