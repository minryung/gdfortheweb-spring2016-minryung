    The Guerrilla Girls: 30 years of punking art world sexism<br>
    <br>
    it is 30 years since the Guerrilla Girls<br>
    a shifting collective of activists committed <br>
    to exposing inequality in the art world – came into being<br>
    during which time a lot has changed, and a lot hasn’t. <br>
    As they point out in their latest campaign, galleries that once<br>
    showed only 10% women artists now show up to 20%. New York <br>
    museums that, in 1985, gave no women artists a solo <br>
    exhibition – including the Guggenheim, the Metropolitan <br>
    and the Whitney – each gave a single woman a solo show last year.
