    The first female typographers<br>
    <br>
    From 1476 to 1484, the Dominican nuns of Sanctum Jacobum<br>
    de Ripoli were printing in Florence.They published many books<br>
    and undoubtedly numerous broadsides. A logbook of the convent<br>
    press was discovered in the eighteenth century and contains the earliest<br>
    record of a female compositor, a nun, who in 1481/82 typeset a folio <br>
    edition of Il Morgante, a work by Italian poet Luigi Pulci (1432â€“84).<br>

    In Mantua, northern Italy, about 1476, Estellina Conat, wife to physician and <br>
    printer Abraham Conat was involved in the typesetting of one of the earliest printed<br>
    Hebrew books, a small (octavo) edition of Behinat Olam. <br>
