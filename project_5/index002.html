    The first female typographers

    From 1476 to 1484, the Dominican nuns of Sanctum Jacobum de Ripoli were printing in Florence.
    They published many books and undoubtedly numerous broadsides. A logbook of the convent press was discovered in the eighteenth century and contains the earliest record of a female compositor, a nun, who in 1481/82 typeset a folio edition of Il Morgante, (ISTC: ip01123500) a work by Italian poet Luigi Pulci (1432â€“84).

    In Mantua, northern Italy, about 1476, Estellina Conat, wife to physician and printer Abraham Conat was involved in the typesetting of one of the earliest printed Hebrew books[2], a small (octavo) edition of Behinat Olam (ISTC: ij00218520). In the colophon she writes:
