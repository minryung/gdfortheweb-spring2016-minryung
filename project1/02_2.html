Behind the Screen<br>
<br>
The core exhibition of the Museum, Behind the Screen<br>
is a one-of-a-kind experience that immerses visitors <br>
in the creative and technical process of producing,<br>
promoting, and presenting films, television shows, and <br>
digital entertainment. Occupying 15,000 square feet <br>
of the Museum's second and third floors, the exhibition <br>
reveals the skills, material resources, and artistic decisions<br>
that go into making moving images. Behind the Screen also<br>
introduces visitors to the history of the moving image,<br>
from nineteenth-century optical toys to the present-day<br>
impact of digital tools on film editing and post-production.<br>
<br>
The exhibition incorporates approximately 1,400 artifacts<br>
from the Museum's collection of the material culture <br>
of the moving image. These include historic film and <br>
television cameras, projectors, television sets, sound <br>
recording equipment, costumes, set design sketches  <br>
and models, make-up, fan magazines, posters, and  <br>
an outstanding collection of licensed merchandise-dolls,<br>
toys, board games, lunch boxes,and more. The Museum has<br>
also been a pioneer in collecting video arcade and <br>
console games, which are on exhibit and available <br>
for play by visitors. Recently acquired objects on view  <br>
include makeup used on the stars of Sex in the City,<br>
a mechanical prop designed by Mike Marino for a climactic <br>
scene in Black Swan, and molds and prototypes produced <br>
during the creation of a King Kong action figure.<br>
