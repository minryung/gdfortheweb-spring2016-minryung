Walkers: Hollywood Afterlives in Art and Artifact<br>
<br>
The reimagining and recycling of Hollywood iconography <br>
in contemporary art, and the way that movies live on <br>
in our personal and cultural memories, are explored <br>
in the exhibition Walkers: Hollywood Afterlives in Art <br>
and Artifact. Organized by independent curator and <br>
scholar Robert M. Rubin, the exhibition includes<br>
120 works by 40 artists that dissect, appropriate, <br>
and redefine some of the past century's most iconic films <br>
through photography, drawing, sculpture, print, and video. <br>
They are joined by a selection of rare film ephemera <br>
re-positioned as artworks ranging from costume designs<br>
for Rosemary's Baby to the complete original key book <br>
stills from The 39 Steps. With a nod to the "walkers," <br>
or zombies,from the TV series The Walking Dead, <br>
the exhibition's title references the lingering power <br>
of film detritus on the imagination of the living.
