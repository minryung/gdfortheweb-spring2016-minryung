To the Moon and Beyond: Graphic Films<br>
and the Inception of 2001: A Space Odyssey<br>
<br>
In July and August 1965, a California-based production company<br>
called Graphic Films, founded by former Disney animator and University<br>
of Southern California professor Lester Novros, conducted research <br>
and created concept sketches for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br>
Among the staff were Con Pederson, who directed a film called To the Moon <br>
and Beyond for Graphic Films that Kubrick saw at the World's Fair <br>
at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park earlier that year, and Douglas Trumbull,<br>
who had recently joined the company as a background artist. After <br>
long-distance collaboration became unsustainable, Pederson and Trumbull<br>
left Graphic Films to work directly with Kubrick at the MGM studios<br>
in England, and were instrumental to the realization of what is <br>
arguably the most important science fiction film ever made..<br>
<br>
Henson's unique body of work continues to delight and inspire <br> 
people around the world. His creations include the enduringly <br> 
popular puppet characters of Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, <br> 
and Muppet films, which established his characters as international <br> 
superstars; and the fantastical worlds of Fraggle Rock,<br> 
The Dark Crystal,and Labyrinth. The exhibition will explore how  <br> 
Henson achieved this remarkable success by working with a team of <br> 
dedicated puppet builders, designers, performers, and writers who  <br> 
shared his restless curiosity, spirit of experimentation,  <br> 
and commitment to creative collaboration.<br>
